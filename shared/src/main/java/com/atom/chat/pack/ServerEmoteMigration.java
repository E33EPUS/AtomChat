/**
 * One-time move of an admin's emotes out of the folder that used to be shared
 * with the player's own stickers.
 *
 * <p>Until now a server built its pack from {@code config/atomchat/emotes/},
 * which is also where the client stores the emotes the player added with the
 * panel's {@code +}. On a dedicated server nobody notices - the two roles live
 * on different machines - but a single game dir (single player, or a LAN host)
 * makes the player's own stickers part of the pack it hands out, and LAN guests
 * receive them.
 *
 * <p>The pack source is now {@code config/atomchat/server-emotes/}. A dedicated
 * server that has emote files in the old folder clearly meant them as admin
 * content (there is no local player to own them), so they are copied over once.
 * Anything else is left alone: on a client those files are the player's own
 * emotes, and moving them would hand the player's collection to every guest.
 *
 * <p>Files are copied, never deleted - if a server rolls back to a build that
 * still reads the old folder, nothing is lost.
