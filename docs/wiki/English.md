## Three things worth knowing first

1. **Client-side mod** — it works without anything on the server (images then go through a third-party image host). Install it on the server too and you unlock **server-hosted media** and **custom avatar sync**.
2. **Windows x64 only, for now** — the jar bundles only Skija's Windows x64 native library; on Linux or macOS the chat panel will not come up.
3. **The whole interface is drawn as vectors by Skija**, with no vanilla chat textures involved. Image messages use the E33Chat `[[CICode]]` protocol, so they interoperate with E33Chat and the ChatImage family.

## Key bindings

| Key | What it does |
|---|---|
| `T` / `/` (the vanilla chat keys) | Opens AtomChat, taking over the vanilla chat screen |
| `Y` (default; change it under Options → Controls → Key Binds → the `AtomChat` category) | Opens the panel directly, restoring the page you were on last |
